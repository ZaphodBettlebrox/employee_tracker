# Employee Tracker

Developers are often tasked with creating interfaces that make it easy for non-developers to view and interact with information stored in databases. Often these interfaces are known as **C**ontent **M**anagement **S**ystems. This program is a bash based buisness manangement center
In this homework assignment, your challenge is to architect and build a solution for managing a company's employees using node, inquirer, and MySQL.

## Getting Started

To run the program, start the my sql server and run "node employee-trackerdata.js", this will begin the looping manangement system. The system asks the user what they would want to do and prompts them with a list of answers as follows:

.add departments -      allows the user to add departments
add roles -             allows the user to add roles
add employees -         allows the user to add employees
view departments -      allows the user to view all departments
view roles -            allows the user to view all roles
view employees -        allows the user to view all employees
update employee roles - allows the user to edit a employees current role to a new role
quit -                  Ends the program

## Built With
